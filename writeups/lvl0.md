# Level 0 to 1:
## Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Commands used:
- ls – listing contents of the directory
- cat – concatenate files and print on the standard output
- exit – exiting the server
