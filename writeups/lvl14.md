# Level 14 to 15:
## Level Goal:
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

## Commands used:
- ls
- cat
- nc – TCP/IP swiss army knife 
- exit

## Solution:
1. used the cat command to see what is in the file mentioned, found the password to enter level 14.
2. opened a manual on nc to find out how to add the port key to connect to the service
3. successfully connected to the service but accidentally pressed the enter button and got a ‘Wrong!’ message.
4. Entered the correct password and found the password for the next level, and exited the current level
