# Level 7 to 8:
## Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

## Commands used:
- ls
- cat
- grep - searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern
- exit

## Solution:
![](./images/7.jpg)
1. used the ls command to find the file data.txt and try to concatenate the file.
2. got a block of data so long it didn’t even allow me to enter commands into the server anymore
3. closed powershell and re-entered the server to try again
4. looked into the grep command since it was the second on the list of suggested commands
5. decided to use it with the word ‘millionth’ and the file data.txt
6. found the password and exited to access the next level
